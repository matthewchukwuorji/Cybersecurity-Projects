#  PrestaShop Deployment on AWS (EC2 + RDS)

## Live Application
*Public URL:*  
http://54.227.119.61

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment of an open-source e-commerce platform (PrestaShop) on AWS using a secure architecture.
The web application is hosted on *Amazon EC2, while the database is hosted separately on **Amazon RDS (MySQL)*. The deployment was completed using AWS Free Tier resources.

## Architecture Design

```
User
  ↓
Elastic IP
  ↓
EC2 (Ubuntu + Apache + PHP + PrestaShop)
  ↓
Amazon RDS (MySQL Database)
```

### Architecture Summary

- EC2 hosts the web application.
- RDS hosts the database.
- The database is not publicly accessible.
- Security Groups control access between services.

---

## AWS Services Used

- Amazon EC2 (Ubuntu 22.04 – t3.micro)
- Amazon RDS (MySQL – db.t4g.micro)
- VPC
- Security Groups
- Elastic IP
- Apache2
- PHP 8.x

---

## Implementation Steps

### 1 Launch EC2 Instance

- Selected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Instance type: t3.micro (Free Tier)
- Configured Security Group:
  - SSH (22) → My IP only
  - HTTP (80) → 0.0.0.0/0
  - HTTPS (443) → 0.0.0.0/0

---

### 2 Install Apache & PHP

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 php php-mysql php-gd php-xml php-mbstring unzip -y php-intl
sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

Updated Apache configuration to allow .htaccess.

---

### 3 Create RDS Database

- Engine: MySQL
- Instance type: db.t4g.micro (Free Tier)
- Public access: *No*
- Created database name and credentials

---

### 4 Configure Security Groups

*EC2 Security Group*
- SSH (22) – My IP
- HTTP (80) – Public access
- MySQL (3306) - EC2 Security Group

*RDS Security Group*
- MySQL (3306) – Source: EC2 Security Group only

This ensures the database can only be accessed from the EC2 instance.

---

### 5 Upload & Install PrestaShop

- Downloaded official production release package
- Uploaded to EC2 via SCP
- Extracted files into `/var/www/html`
- Set proper permissions:

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html
```

- Accessed installer via browser
- Connected to RDS using database endpoint
- Completed installation successfully

---

### 6 Attach Elastic IP

- Allocated Elastic IP
- Associated it with EC2 instance
- Verified application loads successfully

---

## Security Measures Implemented

- Database hosted on separate RDS instance
- RDS not publicly accessible
- MySQL port restricted to EC2 security group only
- SSH restricted to specific IP
- `/install` directory removed after installation

---

## Challenges Encountered

- Missing PHP extensions during installation
- Apache rewrite configuration issues
- Incorrect PrestaShop package downloaded initially
- 404 error after attaching Elastic IP

All issues were resolved through proper troubleshooting and configuration updates.

## Conclusion

The PrestaShop application was successfully deployed using AWS Free Tier services with a secure 3-tier architecture separating the application and database layers. This project demonstrates hands-on experience with AWS infrastructure, Linux server configuration, and web application deployment.
